# Current Project Status - Clean State

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Status:** Project cleanup completed

## Project Overview

Victurus is now in a clean, organized state with all obsolete development files archived and documentation updated to reflect the current implementation.

## Current File Count (Post-Cleanup)

### Core Application Files
- **Main Entry:** `main.py` + `requirements.txt`
- **UI Components:** ~25 files in `ui/` (widgets, maps, dialogs, controllers, menus, state)
- **Game Logic:** 4 files in `game/` (player_status, ship_state, travel, travel_flow) 
- **Data Layer:** 4 files in `data/` (db, schema, seed, universe data)
- **Save System:** 7 files in `save/` (models, serializers, paths, ui_config, etc.)
- **Game Controller:** 6 files in `game_controller/` (simulation, logging, config)
- **Configuration:** 1 file in `settings/` (system_config)

### Supporting Files
- **Assets:** 100+ image files organized by type
- **Documentation:** 8 current docs in `docs/`
- **Tests:** 4 essential test files in `tests/`
- **Database:** SQLite database in `database/`
- **Logs:** Component-specific log files in `logs/`

### Archived Files (Preserved)
- **Obsolete Tests:** 25+ files in `archive/obsolete_tests/`
- **Debug Scripts:** 7+ files in `archive/debug_scripts/`

## Ready for Next Development Phase

The project is now in optimal condition for the next development phase:

1. **Clean codebase** - Easy to navigate and understand
2. **Stable foundation** - All core systems working
3. **Good architecture** - Well-structured for expansion
4. **Documentation** - Current and comprehensive
5. **Preserved history** - All development work archived

## Next Recommended Development

With the project cleaned up, the logical next steps are:

1. **Trading System** - Build on the existing station interaction framework
2. **Cargo Management** - Extend the ship state system
3. **Economic Model** - Add supply/demand to the database layer
4. **Mission System** - Create quest and objective tracking

The clean, well-organized codebase makes these additions much more straightforward than they would have been with the cluttered previous state.
