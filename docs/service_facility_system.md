# Station Service Facility System

## Overview

The Victurus game now includes a realistic station service system where not all stations provide all services. Stations must have specific facilities to offer certain services, creating a more immersive and strategic economy.

## Implementation Summary

### Database Changes

**New Service Facility Types Added:**
- `Fuel Depot` - Provides refueling services (177 stations, 80.8% coverage)
- `Repair Bay` - Provides ship repair services (151 stations, 68.9% coverage)  
- `Trading Post` - Provides market/trading services (126 stations, 57.5% coverage)
- `Mission Board` - Provides mission services (84 stations)
- `Ship Outfitter` - Provides ship outfitting services (95 stations)
- `Storage Vault` - Provides personal storage services (101 stations)

**Database Functions Added:**
```python
# Get all facilities at a specific location
get_location_facilities(location_id: int) -> List[Dict]

# Get available services at a station based on its facilities  
get_station_services(location_id: int) -> List[str]
```

### Service Mapping

The system maps facility types to services:

```python
service_mappings = {
    'Repair Bay': 'repair',
    'Fuel Depot': 'refuel', 
    'Trading Post': 'market',
    'Mission Board': 'missions',
    'Ship Outfitter': 'outfitting',
    'Storage Vault': 'storage',
    # Production facilities that might offer services
    'Fabricator': 'outfitting',  # Can craft ship parts
    'Med Lab': 'medical',        # Medical services
    'Refinery': 'market',        # May sell refined goods
}
```

### Actions Panel Integration

The Actions Panel now uses `db.get_station_services(location_id)` to determine which service buttons to display when docked at a station. Only available services are shown, creating realistic differentiation between stations.

**Service Actions Available:**
- **Refuel Ship** - Available at stations with Fuel Depots
- **Repair Ship** - Available at stations with Repair Bays
- **Commodities Market** - Available at stations with Trading Posts
- **Ship Outfitting** - Available at stations with Ship Outfitters
- **Storage Vault** - Available at stations with Storage Vaults
- **Medical Bay** - Available at stations with Med Labs

### Station Distribution Strategy

Service facilities were distributed based on system economic tags:

**Basic Services:**
- Fuel Depot: 80% probability (most stations need refueling)
- Repair Bay: 70% probability (common service)

**Trade Services:**
- Trading Post: 90% in tradehub systems, 50% elsewhere
- Mission Board: 70% in tradehub systems, 30% elsewhere

**High-Tech Services:**
- Ship Outfitter: 80% in hightech systems, 30% elsewhere  
- Storage Vault: 60% in hightech systems, 40% elsewhere

## Files Modified

### Core Database Layer
- `data/db.py` - Added `get_location_facilities()` and `get_station_services()` functions

### UI Layer  
- `ui/widgets/actions_panel.py` - Updated `_get_station_docked_actions()` to use actual service availability

### Database Population
- `tests/add_service_facilities_direct.py` - Script to add service facilities to existing stations

## Testing

Comprehensive testing shows:
- ✅ 734 total service facilities added across 216/219 stations (98.6% coverage)
- ✅ Good service distribution with 80% refuel, 69% repair, 58% market coverage
- ✅ Actions Panel correctly shows only available services
- ✅ Database functions work correctly with existing UI

## Usage

### For Developers

```python
from data import db

# Check what services a station offers
location_id = 16
services = db.get_station_services(location_id)
# Returns: ['refuel', 'repair', 'market']

# Get detailed facility information
facilities = db.get_location_facilities(location_id)
# Returns: [{'facility_type': 'Fuel Depot', ...}, ...]
```

### For Game Design

The system enables strategic gameplay where:
- Players must plan routes around service availability
- Not all stations provide all services, creating specialization
- Trade hubs naturally have more services than frontier stations
- High-tech systems offer advanced services like outfitting

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Pricing** - Service prices could vary based on facility quality/rarity
2. **Service Quality** - Different facilities could offer different service levels
3. **Player Investment** - Players could invest in station upgrades
4. **Supply Chains** - Services could depend on local resource availability

## Economy System Readiness

✅ **READY** - The service facility system provides the foundation for a realistic economy where:
- Station services create meaningful location differentiation
- Players must consider service availability in travel planning
- Trade and logistics become more strategic elements
- The universe feels more alive and varied

This system replaces the previous assumption that all stations provide all services, creating a more immersive and realistic space trading experience.
